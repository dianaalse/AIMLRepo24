Data Card

The UNSW-NB15 dataset was created for the purpose of network intrusion detection systems and evaluating machine learning models for network traffic analysis and anomaly detection.

The dataset was created by the Cyber Range Lab at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) Canberra. It was created by Dr. Nour Moustafa and Jill Slay. The funding source for creating the dataset is not explicitly mentioned.

The instances in the dataset represent network traffic records, including both normal activities and synthetic contemporary attack behaviors.

The dataset contains a total of 2,540,044 records, out of which 175,341 records are in the training set, and 82,332 records are in the testing set.

The information provided does not explicitly mention if there is any missing data in the dataset.

The information provided does not indicate if the dataset contains any confidential data.

The raw network packets were created by the IXIA PerfectStorm tool in the Cyber Range Lab at UNSW Canberra for generating a hybrid of real modern normal activities and synthetic contemporary attack behaviors. The tcpdump tool was utilized to capture 100 GB of the raw traffic (e.g., Pcap files).

The information provided does not mention if the data is a sample of a larger subset or the sampling strategy used.

The information provided does not specify the time frame over which the data was collected.

The information provided does not mention any specific preprocessing, cleaning, or labeling steps performed on the data.

The information is not provided.

The dataset could potentially be used for other tasks related to network traffic analysis, such as anomaly detection, intrusion prevention systems, and network forensics.

The information provided does not mention any specific concerns or risks associated with the dataset composition or collection process that might impact future uses.
The information provided does not mention any tasks for which the dataset should not be used.
